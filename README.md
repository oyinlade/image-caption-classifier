## ‚ú® Features 

* Real-time image classification using state-of-the-art deep learning models
* Natural language caption generation
* Support for multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
* Easy-to-use REST API
* Batch processing capabilities
* Comprehensive evaluation metrics

## üöÄ Quick Start
Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* PyTorch 2.0+
* CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)

## Installation

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/oyinlade/image-caption-classifier.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd image-caption-classifier

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```
from caption_classifier import ImageCaptionClassifier

# Initialize the classifier
classifier = ImageCaptionClassifier()

# Classify a single image
result = classifier.process_image("path/to/your/image.jpg")
